Things we need to decide on:
	- how are we selecting things?
		- draggable selections?
		- filter bars?
		- ctrl click functionality?
		
	- how exactly are we representing data?
		- Do we want to store a list of all the variable names somewhere?? Because 
		at this point I have no idea what variables we are keeping track of without 
		getting the map in DataRow and going through them individually.
		- possibly use enums?
		
	- aggregate vis's -> do we want to have a generic bar graph that does the same thing for mag as it
		does for things like depth? or do we want this vis to be fundamentally different depending on 
		what we are actually graphing?
		
	- how do we want to represent date?
		- we could just make our own Date object since Java killed theirs. 
	
	- are we going to allow for filtering based on different types of parameters?
		- amount of a particular variable? (mag > x)
		- by a specific variable?
